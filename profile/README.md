## Welcome to the Snowdog Temple of Code üëã

Thanks to our years of experience with Magento, Adobe Commerce, Hyv√§ and commercetools, we deliver high quality, ADA/EAA compliant and scalable e-commerce solutions that strengthen many brands around the world. We love open source and have been contributing to it since our inception in 2009. Explore our e-commerce development, customer experience and mobile application development services at [Snowdog website](https://snow.dog/services).

Our most popular repositories:

‚≠êÔ∏è [Magento 2 mega menu](https://github.com/SnowdogApps/magento2-menu)

‚≠êÔ∏è [a11y audit tool](https://github.com/SnowdogApps/a11y-audit-tool)

‚≠êÔ∏è [Frontools](https://github.com/SnowdogApps/magento2-frontools) (deprecated due to Hyv√§ switch but maintained by friends in one of forks)

The core of our work has always been around Magento, we developed a rather popular open source frontend alternative called [Alpaca](https://github.com/SnowdogApps/magento2-alpaca-theme), but since we decided to join the [Hyv√§](https://github.com/hyva-themes ) movement, most of the new Magento work falls under [Hyv√§ Compatibility Category](https://github.com/topics/snowdog-hyva).

Since 2011 Snowdog is the organizer of the famous CEE tech event called [Meet Magento Poland](https://meetmagento.pl) üß°, bringing together every year the brightest minds from the Magento, [Mage-OS](https://github.com/mage-os) and Adobe Commerce world. We also co-organize and support [Poznan Magento Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/magentopoznan/) and [Poznan #A11y Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/poznan-a11y-meetup/).
